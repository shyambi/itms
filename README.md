     Goal of this project is to create a comprehensive solution for managing enterperise IT ifrastructure information.
Traditionally IT dept guys from most of the medium, small size companies use excel sheets, notepad etc to manage this information. But as this information is not centralized and every team member has its copy different from others, may lead to problems. Significant data loss can occur and many confusions among IT team are possible.

     Keeping these challanges in mind, to make all IT process simple. Everyone in the IT team will have acess to same copy of information so everyone can work on each ticket. In emergency times, this solution has its ownn advantages. Suppose your one of the IT member is on vacation and his computer has the data about IT resources he works on. Meanwhile if some emergency tickets came, who will solve it? And How? But If you have a centralized system which will have all the IT information in a organized way anyone from team can solve the ticket.

    Again while using sheets, notepads, docs to store information eveyone will have its own format which he/she likes. But other team members many times does not understand the the format leading to many misunderstandings.
